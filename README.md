# PRODIGY_DS_03

## Project Overview

In this project, I focused on developing a predictive model to determine whether customers would subscribe to a term deposit. Using demographic and behavioral data from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution, I built a decision tree classifier to analyze customer characteristics such as age, job, marital status, education, and account balance. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, served as the foundation for this analysis.

## Dataset
This project utilizes a dataset from direct marketing campaigns (via phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset includes a range of features, such as client demographics, details of previous marketing interactions, and the campaign outcome, indicating whether a client subscribed to a term deposit.

## Results/Findings
The project successfully developed decision tree classifiers utilizing both the Gini impurity and entropy criteria. The models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting term deposit subscriptions, with the classifier using the Gini impurity criterion marginally outperforming the entropy-based model. Notably, the Gini-based model achieved better testing accuracy and higher recall for the positive class, making it slightly more effective at identifying customers likely to subscribe.

## Conclusion  
This project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting term deposit subscriptions for direct marketing campaigns. By utilizing predictive analytics, banks can refine their marketing strategies, improve targeting, and foster stronger customer engagement, ultimately boosting campaign efficiency and success rates.  

Thank you for taking the time to review my internship task submission!
